# Advent of Code 2020
For the second year, I am publishing (yet another) set of solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) problems, written in Rust.

The goals for these solutions are the same as in the previous year: to be self-contained (using _zero_ external crates), reasonably general (working on every valid input), compact and performant, without going overboard with error handling, custom types or traits.

## Usage

The inputs are expected in the [input](./input/) folder.

Run any of the solutions with `cargo run --release --bin DAY_NUMBER`.

Run the tests with `cargo test`.
